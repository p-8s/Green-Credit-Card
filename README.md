# LSE-Standard Chartered Practitioners' Challenge 2021

This repository contains our team's solution to LSE-Standard Chartered Practitioners' Challenge 2021. Focusing on China's ESG development and green finance opportunities, we proposed a Green Credit Card scheme targeting at married women under age 35 to incentivise green consumption. Our work was awarded the second place in the Challenge.

## The Challenge 

### Description

1. Research on China's ESG development history and current status with a particular focus on Green Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Green Shenzhen
2. Identify the appetite for Sustainable Development Goals across Standard Chartered's market presence and advise on capital allocation
3. Conduct competitor analysis on competitors' market promotion and positioning
4. Identify the latest regulatory priorities and enabling factors in supporting sustainable finance growth, especially in GBA and Shenzhen


### Objective

Structure and propose at least one Sustainable Finance related product

## Our Solution

We conducted qualitative and quantitative researches on ESG development in China and the credit card market. Our proposed product is a Green Credit Card which lowers the interest rate as users' greeen consumption increases. Full details can be referred to in [our report](https://github.com/p-8s/Green-Credit-Card/blob/master/Report.pdf)

In our Green Credit Card profitability analysis, we modelled default risk using random forest and calculated expected profit following a model proposed by [So et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923613002625). We argue that by lowering interest rate for higher consumption amount, the overall profitability level can be mainted.
